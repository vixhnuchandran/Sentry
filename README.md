# Sentry IDS

Sentry is an Intrusion Detection System that monitors server logs for failed login attempts and alerts administrators about potential threats.

## Features

    git clone https://github.com/vixhnuchandran/sentry.git
    cd sentry
    ```

2. (Optional) Install the project locally:

    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```

## Configuration
